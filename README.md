# Google AdSense Code for React.JS

This code will help you to create a Google AdSense Ad component that you can use to show ads on different pages. You need to use a useEffect hook that fires an event for each component that tells AdSense to send ad data. Lastly, you need to return the JSX of the Ad container that is used with **INS** HTML tag.
